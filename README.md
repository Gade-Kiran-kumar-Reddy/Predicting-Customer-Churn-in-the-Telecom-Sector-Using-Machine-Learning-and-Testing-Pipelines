# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-the-Telecom-Sector-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Testing-Pipelines

**Description**
"This project addresses a common business challenge: identifying which telecom customers are likely to leave the service. Accurately predicting churn allows companies to take proactive measures, such as offering incentives or improving customer support, which can significantly reduce revenue loss."

"To tackle this, I used machine learning techniques to build classification models that analyze historical customer data â€” such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure â€” to predict whether a customer is likely to churn."

"What makes this project unique is that Iâ€™m not only focusing on model performance, but also on the quality and reliability of the entire machine learning pipeline. I've applied testing practices from my background as a Software Test Engineer â€” including unit tests for data preprocessing, model evaluation assertions, and automated checks using CI/CD tools."

"This ensures the model is not just accurate, but also robust, maintainable, and ready for real-world deployment â€” aligning with modern SDET and MLOps expectations."

**Research Questions**
How accurately can machine learning models predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage data?

How can automated testing improve the robustness and reliability of a churn prediction pipeline?
